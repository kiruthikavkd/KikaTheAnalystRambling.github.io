													Starting in a new team can be overwhelming especially if you haven't done it before.
													This read will guide you on some first steps and how to stay on top of
													things when it seems that you are in college learning new stuff 
													every single day. The first few months are agreeably difficult but with a 
													few steps it could be easier if not stress-free.

												<h3>Wondering why should you read through my ramblings?</h3>
												<p>
													You don't need to. But if you have got 30 mins there are some pretty awesome tips on how 
													you could tackle all those difficult moments as a business analyst. 
												</p>
												<p>
													Why hear my tips? </br>
													I have been in the same situation especially with 7 complex products implemented in 8 years.
													You can imagine me getting comfortable with a team and then immediately
													pulled into another new one. After 2 such instances I knew this was going to be 
													my new normal and hence made attempts to make my life easier. 
													As a business analyst's usual, I asked what do I need to solve 
													this problem of being with a new team every year and 
													the answer were these tips. I shared these with some of my colleagues and it definitely 
													made their transitions over teams smoother. Hopefully it will make your 
													transition a bit easier too.

												<h3>Also...</h3>
												<p>
													If you feel like you are tackling a "why does it happen to me" situation and want some help,
													feel free to drop me an email and I would be more than happy to guide you, even if it simply means 
													that you have the solution but want to know if it is ok to do it. 
													Please find my contact details below. 
													This is a blog with monthly updates. And soon I am planning a search functionality
													to be able to find other articles in the specific reads section.
