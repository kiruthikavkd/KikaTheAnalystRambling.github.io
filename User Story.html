												<h2>What is a user story?</h2>
												<p>A comprehensive description of what a user desires to do with the capability.</p>

												<h3>Why is a user story written</h3>
												<p>
													Initially, when the world was still 'waterfalling', we had a source-of-truth called 
													Business Requirements Document (often catcalled BRD). This document was our reference, blame-taker 
													and most importantly evidence of all the discussion the team had (of course excluding the small talks about 
													the weather, the vacation and sick leaves) and the conclusion we made. <br/> 
													In the agile world, standards changed. We no more wanted one document and but multiple ones 
													(this is quite useful when you have to update, which we will often do, owing multiple stakeholders in our great team). 
													In agile we have small digestible chunks of information (so we don't scare the developers of the work they need to do), 
													so we split the master document into workable components. Consider that you want play in a PS (or xbox, 
													whichever fancies you), we would have to first check if we have a PS, switch it on, 
													then check if we miraculously purchased the game with that meagre salary, load it, 
													then take a decision to load a new game or continue our progress we made ages ago and then
													finally play. </br>
													In a BRD, often times the 2 steps listed would be to check if we have the game and then play it. 
													But in a user story, all these steps should be detailed. 
												</p>

												<h3>What makes your user story easy to understand?</h3>
												<p>
													If you have all the detailed description, the next step to make your user story great, is just to add 
													more details. Considering the same PS example above, what should be done if the PS is already on or 
													what if your evil sibling is holding the only controller at home? Add these and your user story is 
													ready for review.
												</p>
												<p>
													Just one small detail. </br>
													Sometimes you will feel like the details laid out in each user story is repetitive. For example if there are 
													mulitple PS games, for each of which there is a user story written on how-to-play, then the information switching it
													on and searching the game will be required for each game's user story. Remember this - 'Though all the stories have
													a single author, the readers are different', so there is huge need of laying out details even if it is repetitive 
													across many similar user stories.

												<h3>The Template</h3>
												<strong>Functional:</strong> </br>
												<p>
													"As a [user], I should be able to [the desired capability], so that I can [the need for the capability]"
												</p> 
												<strong>System / Technical:</strong> </br>
												<p>
													"As a [system], it should be able to [the desired function], so that [user] can [the need for the function]."
												</p>
												<strong>Examples</strong> </br>
												<ol>
													<li>As an avid gamer, 
														I should be able to check the list of games I have in my PS, 
														so that I can select one of them to play.</li>
													<li>As a sneaky child, 
														I should be able to check if my parent is playing a game on a PS, 
														so that I can sneak up on them to get my playtime.</li>
													<li>As a PS4 AI system, 
														I should be able to detect a presence of a child in the gaming room, 
														so that I can display the fake office meeting video to save the parent.</li>
