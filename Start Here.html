													Starting in a new team can be overwhelming especially if you haven't done it before.
													This read will guide you on some first steps and how to stay on top of
													things when it seems that you are in college learning new stuff 
													every single day. The first few months are agreeably difficult but with a 
													few steps it could be easier if not stress-free.

														<h3>
															Question everything 
															(only project related stuff, 
															don’t start questioning your colleague’s integrity! 
															Just saying.)
														</h3>
														<p>
															As a business analyst you will mostly be answering questions (usually from the developer, 
															the tester, the manager and often times the business stakeholders). So first ask questions. 
															Questions that you think will clarify what is the work, what is the purpose of the work, 
															what defines the work’s success, what will be considered failure, 
															what defines the USP (unique selling point), who is this, 
															why are they pulled into this meeting. Anything basically that you don’t know question it. 
															Your team will thank you since they themselves won’t know the answers, but your question 
															will at least help them start a discussion or streamline a meeting towards the right track.
														</p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<h3>
															Get a proper knowledge transfer.
														</h3>
														<p>
															I can’t stress this point enough. Usually you will replace an employee who 
															has already given up their passion for the product. Getting them to talk to you 
															about the project will be difficult but don’t hesitate to ask them everything you 
															can think of. Even the inside knowledge of how each  stakeholder will respond or interact.
															(don’t act on those prejudices but it is good to know the premise you will be 
															stepping into and it will surprise you how much of a headstart it can give you 
															over randomly jumping into a pool full of fishes already familiar with the life
															threatening weeds in the water.
														</p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<h3>
															If you don’t find a thing you would find useful, create it.
														</h3>
														<p>
															Not all projects will be properly documented nor will everyone 
															in the project know everything. So people yourself into understanding 
															the project as much as you can and when you can’t find a particular information 
															or documentation, make sure to get your hands dirty and dive into the product. 
															Gets some hands on if possible and know what your product feels like to work on
														</p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<h3>
															Document everything you get to know in the first few months.
														</h3>
														<p>
															The standards, the stakeholder list everything. It will save a lot of time when you have to give a knowledge transfer to someone replacing you or someone new in the team. Just pass on the deck and then have clarification sessions. It will save time for the both of you.
														</p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<h3>
															Understand technology stacks.
														</h3>
														<p>
															Understand the core of which technologies your product is built on.
															<ul>
																<li>A front end (the actual application that the user interacts with / user interface)</li>
																<li>A middleware (a system between the product and the operating system it is installed into for information-exchange or management & support)</li>
																<li>A backend (that handles all data / information and their flow)</li>
																<li>Possibly also a third party software or service</li>
															</ul>
														</p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<h3>
															Understand the processes involved.
														</h3>
														<p>
															<ul>
																<li>What does a sprint look like?</li>
																<li>Any standards followed that are product/company specific (like a brand might decide to include its logo in all the screens of its application so any new screen introduced should have a logo and it should be included as a part of your story)</li>
																<li>Any processes followed to raise a request for a service or product related activities?</li>
																<li>Any special approval teams involved and what type of requirements should they be involved in?</li>
															</ul>
														</p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<h3>
															Create templates and standards for repetitive efforts.
														</h3>
														<p>
															When you are involved in a big product that uses/caters to third party softwares/services, make sure to get the template for the different types of requirements involved (for example, if it is a backend change that you request to a vendor who is catering to all your data needs), you need to make a template of the requirements that you would get or acceptance criteria that you will define, so that the next time you encounter the same type of requirement you will not deviate from the standards and best practices). If such a template is not already in use create one please. It will save a lot of time for everyone to follow a process especially when a third party is involved.
														</p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<h3>
															Interact with team. Duh!
														</h3>
														<p>
															Learn from your team. Sit in development or architecture discussion even though you aren’t expected to contribute in any way. This will make you used to the jargons and the terms the team is using and will be particularly helpful when working in large-scale projects.
														</p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<h3>
															Minutes of meeting/discussions/small-talks
														</h3>
														<p>
															Popular to the contrary belief that the most we do in meetings is to ask if everyone can hear us (though we start with that excruciatingly painful first few minutes to go to the crux of the meeting), we really discuss things that matter (at least to the team). These interactions and discussions will throw light to some major functions of the team or the project (that you otherwise would have only known when you are a few months older)
															So even if you aren’t responsible for sending out the minutes of meeting, take time to draft one for your own use.															
														</p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<h3>
															Not everyone knows everything, but everyone brings something to the table.
														</h3>
														<p>
															Don’t hesitate to get your doubts clarified even if it might make you look ignorant (better know it for sure than assume). Whenever you notice and take a problem to the team bring possible solutions or at least the steps to arrive at a solution (this applies to all types of jobs)
